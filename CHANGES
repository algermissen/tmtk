  * Cleaned up all 'Dummy Errors' and the GS_xxx error codes.
    However, there still needs to be work done on the actual
    erro codes.

  * Fixed errors due to missing parsers. Omnivore now sets
    the global var tmtk_error if parser is missing.
    This can also be improved in the future.

  * Improved -h output of tm a little, also added \l commad
    to query interfac that lists the TMAs in the map.

  * Fixed bug in Omnivore's XPath expression construction

  * Added sample tm uses to the README file

13 Nov 2003 "Jan Algermissen <algermissen@acm.org>"

  * Changed name of value type LocatorSet to TextSet, because that's
    what it actually is.


27 Nov 2003 "Jan Algermissen <algermissen@acm.org>"

  * Omnivore's position is now appended to error message in
    tm_omnivore_set_error() directly.
