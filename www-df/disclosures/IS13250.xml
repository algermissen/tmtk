    This is a simplified version of the core TMA implicitly defined by the
    Topic Maps Reference Model.

  <property>
    <name>UniqueName</name>
    <description>
      This property stores the implicit name of assertion types and
      roles provided by the &lt;name&gt; elements inside assertion type
      definitions in TMAs. Explicitly defining this property has the advantage
      that assertion types and roles can be identified by their name in queries.

    <valueType>Text</valueType>
    <sidp>yes</sidp>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>a-sidp</name>
    <description>
      This property is used to express the subject of an assertion
      (the A-topic). Every value of this property represents exactly
      one assertion (the proxy for a relationship) by connecting
      the T-,R-,x-, and A-topics of an assertion.
      Note that C-topics are only represented implicitly in this simplified
      IS13250 TMA, mostly in order to keep the a-sidp's value type as simple
      as possible.

  x-op isn't yet defined as it depends on a-sidp and property
